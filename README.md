This project is a solution to a "Sr. UI Developer" assignment to build and integrate a responsive sidebar into a web page.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The sidebar adapts to different screen sizes, functioning as a full-width menu on mobile and a fixed-width sidebar on desktop.

* **Interactive Menus:** The main sidebar toggles a secondary, multi-level menu. The secondary menu expands to show labels and can be collapsed to show icons only.

* **Scrollable Content:** The secondary menu's item list is now scrollable to accommodate a large number of items without overflowing.

* **Smooth Animations:** All transitions and menu interactions are designed with smooth, fluid animations.

* **Dark/Light Theme:** A theme switcher is included to toggle between dark and light color schemes.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and content.

* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, transitions, and animations.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive functionality, including menu toggling and theme switching.

* **Boxicons:** An external icon library used to provide all the icons.

## How to Run

1. Save the provided code as an `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js` file.

2. Open the file in any modern web browser.

3. The sidebar will be immediately visible on the left side of the page. You can click on the main menu items to reveal the secondary menu.
